# Face2Face

<center>Facial recognition software to detect during an interview or interrogation if someone is lying.</center>

## Facial Recognition

Through Microsoft Azure's Facial Recognition API (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/), we  were able to display emotions, facial landmarks, face attributes, and many more characteristics given through the algorithm. Through the data we collected, we then parse through the data and run it through an algorithm we created to determine if the interviewee or the interrogatee are telling the truth or not.
